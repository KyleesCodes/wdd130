      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        On my home page is where all of my target audience will see important information regarding the venue, what types of activities are available and where the full venue is located. Some questions that will get answered on this page would be about the pricing for the tickets, the location layout and parking details. Additionally, this page will provide guests with information regarding the food vendors scattered throughout the venue. The reason why the audience won’t go to other sites for this information is because the information regarding the event will be exclusively released on my site.With this information page, users will be able to decide if they wish to attend the event as well as be able to be fully informed about the general details about the event. Without this page, there would be no reliable information for users out there regarding this convention. On this page there will be a statement posted saying that this is the only site where information will be available for the event with an email that users can email information to if they find a site spreading information (whether false or true information) about the event when they are not given permission to do so. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>The Anime Side</h3>
      <p>
        On my second page, which is about the Anime side of the event, users would find specific information regarding what is offered to anime fans at the convention. This would also host information about voice actors who plan to attend and host a meet-n-greet at the event. Additionally, the floor plan for the rooms for this part of the event as well as a detailed list of where all anime specific events will take place at what time will be laid out. Users will also be able to use this information to plan out their visit in the most efficient way for them to fully enjoy the event. Without this page users would only know the general information about the event without being able to fully know what is available to do. The reason why users would use this page instead of relying on other sites is because this page will hold all of the information regarding this specific part of the event whereas there won’t be any other sites that will display this information. Some questions that may get answered on this page that users may have is where to find each event, which voice actors will be attending for meet-n-greets, how much special events will cost to get in and what time every smaller event is at.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Kpop Side</h3>
      <p>
        On my third page, which is about the Kpop side of the event, users will be able to find information about specific kpop events that will be held at the venue. Some events available will include performances by other fans, song covers and special guests. This page will hold exclusive information regarding all things related to this part of the event. Users will not be able to find the information of this event elsewhere because of the fact that no other parties will be authorized to release the information of the whole event. The only information that would be available elsewhere is that the special guests are only authorized to reveal that they will be in attendance. The special guests will then be required to link the page in all posts they make regarding the event which will also increase the flow of traffic to the website. This will be the only official page for the event. Some questions that may get answered on this page that users may have is where to find every performance, who will be performing, where to find the kpop dance games, what time every smaller event is at, which celebrities will be there and where to find everything available on the kpop side of the event.
