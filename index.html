            <p>Hello, this is my second time taking this class. Unfortunately I failed this class my previous semester due to personal circumstances, but I took a semester off to recover and I am back to studying. I have already completed most of the course work for this class once before, but I went ahead and deleted all the work I had done before so all of my assingments will be done along with the course. I am excited to get back to studying and I will work hard this semester!</p>
