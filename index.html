            <p>Hello, this is my second time taking this class. Unfortunately I failed this class my previous semester due to personal circumstances, but I took a semester off to recover and I am back to studying. I have already completed most of the course work for this class once before, but I went ahead and deleted all the work I had done before so all of my assingments will be done along with the course. I am excited to get back to studying and I will work hard this semester! A little bit about me is that I am 23 years old, I have a kitten name Mochi, and I work for an amazing company from the comfort of my own home. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, listening to music, going on drives (especially with my best friend), and watching whatever I am in the mood for. Currently I know 1 language fluently and I am a beginner in another with plans to study abroad to learn the language more. I have 2 older brothers and no younger siblings. My favorite band is BTS, but I listen to a lot of different music from different genres. For entertainment, I love to enjoy the romance and action genres. I am too much of a scaredy cat to enjoy horror even though I would like to. My parents and I also enjoy to travel a lot, mainly to the Disney parks or on Disney cruises! Though I love Disney trips, I do plan to travel more in ways that aren't Disney run. My biggest goal in life is to buy my parents and myself our own homes.</p>

            <p>Arizona is a desert state that is located next to California and Mexico. It is known for its cactus, the Grand Canyon, and the severe weather. What some people don't know about Arizona is that we still receive snow yearly in some parts of the state! The most well known city in Arizona is Phoenix, which is located at the heart of many different cities (mine included). It takes about 1 and a half hours to drive from one side of the Phoenix metro area to the other side as long as there is no rush hour traffic.</p>
